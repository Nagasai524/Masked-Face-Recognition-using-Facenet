# Masked-Face-Recognition-using-MTCNN-and-FaceNet (End-to-End-Deploymnet-using-Streamlit)
Existing Face Recognition systems fail in recognizing the persons when they are masked but I have developed a face recognition system that is capable of recognizing persons even when they are masked with different kinds of occlusion such as Facemasks, templates, Handkerchiefs, and so on. I have even deployed my model using Streamlit.
